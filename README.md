# ðŸ“˜ TypeScript Concepts Explained

## âœ¨ Topic 1: Differences Between `interface` and `type` in TypeScript

In TypeScript, both `interface` and `type` can be used to describe the shape of an object. However, they have subtle differences in usage and capabilities.

### ðŸ”¹ Similarities

Both `interface` and `type` allow you to define objects with properties:

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```

### ðŸ”¸ Key Differences

#### 1. **Extending**

* `interface` can be extended multiple times.
* `type` can extend other types using intersections (`&`).

```ts
interface Animal {
  name: string;
}
interface Dog extends Animal {
  breed: string;
}

type Cat = Animal & { breed: string };
```

#### 2. **Declaration Merging**

* Interfaces support declaration merging, where multiple interfaces with the same name get merged.
* Types do **not** support merging.

```ts
interface Box {
  height: number;
}
interface Box {
  width: number;
}
// Box now has both height and width
```

#### 3. **Use Cases**

* Use `interface` when working with object shapes or class contracts.
* Use `type` when you need unions, intersections, or to define primitives, tuples, etc.

```ts
type ID = string | number;
type Coordinates = [number, number];
```

### âœ… Conclusion

Use `interface` for structured object shapes, especially when working with classes or extending existing contracts. Use `type` when you need flexibility with unions, primitives, or tuples.

## âœ¨ Topic 2: Understanding `any`, `unknown`, and `never` in TypeScript

TypeScript provides powerful types to describe values safely. Among these are `any`, `unknown`, and `never`, which serve different purposes.

### ðŸ”¹ `any`

* Disables all type checking.
* Allows any operation without compiler error.
* Use **cautiously**â€”it defeats the purpose of TypeScript.

```ts
let value: any = 5;
value = "hello";
value.toUpperCase(); // No error, even if not safe
```

### ðŸ”¹ `unknown`

* Similar to `any`, but safer.
* You **must** narrow the type before using it.

```ts
let input: unknown = "TypeScript";

if (typeof input === "string") {
  console.log(input.toUpperCase()); // Safe
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ `never`

* Represents values that **never occur**.
* Used for functions that never return (e.g., infinite loop or throw error).

```ts
function throwError(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}
```

### âœ… Conclusion

* Use `any` **sparingly**, only when migrating or integrating with dynamic data.
* Prefer `unknown` for values from external sources (like API responses).
* Use `never` to represent impossible logic paths or error-handling functions.

## âœ… Final Words

Understanding and using TypeScriptâ€™s advanced types correctly improves **code safety, readability, and maintainability**. Interfaces, types, and specific type keywords (`any`, `unknown`, `never`) are powerful tools when used thoughtfully.
